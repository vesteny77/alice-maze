test1：stop executing upon landing on a white square
test2：pick the shorter path as the solution
test3：when step size varies, the program continue executing on the repeated grid
test4：out of bound
test5：check if the step size changes on red or yellow arrows
test6: when step size == 0, we abandon the path
